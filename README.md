web designer test for Odoo

Hello,

Here is my test for the Odoo web designer job.

I tried to respect the example as much as possible. 
However, I did modify a few things like same sized titles for all sections of the main part or correctly 
aligning the card section as it made more sense to me this way.

I imported the Boostrap CSS in my .scss file but of course could not upload it here as there are too many files.

For more info you can always contact me. I am still very enthusiastic about joining your team.
