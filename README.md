web designer test for odoo

Hello,

Here is my test for the odoo web designer job.

I tried to respect the example as much as possible, however I did modify a few things,
like same sized titles for all sections of the main part or correctly aligning the card section 
as it made more sense to me this way.

I imported the boostrap css in my sass file but of course could not upload it here as there are too many files.

I hope everything is ok like this as I am very enthusiastic about joining your team.

For more info you can always contact me.
